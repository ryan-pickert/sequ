# About SEQU
SEQU is a modular sequencing program built on <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a>.

I am constantly working on SEQU in my spare time as a passion project.
This project is in very early development so there are a lot of bugs and missing features!

Being that it is built on Tone.js, SEQU is availiable in your browser.
