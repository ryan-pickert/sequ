Sequ is a multi-track step sequencer with a focus on randomization.

Sequ uses <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> as a clock source and <a href="https://github.com/djipco/webmidi">WebMidi.js</a> to send MIDI data.

**Features**
* Generate random squences using a set scale
* Generate a new sequence every cycle
* Activate/deactivate steps to your liking
* Up to four tracks playing simultaneously
* Send tracks to different devices or MIDI channels

**Quick Start Guide**

Connect your MIDI devices (if they aren't already) and restart the page.
All availiable devices will be listed under 'DEVICES' on the left.
>The 'device' slider will default to the last MIDI device. 


To generate a sequence:
1. Set the parameters to your liking and hit the 'generate' button.
2. Choose the desired device and MIDI channel.
3. Hit 'play' to start the sequence.

Notes:
- A sequence MUST be generated before starting it. Generating a new sequence while it is playing will have no effect until you restart it.
- All other parameters (including MIDI device and channel) must also be set before the sequence is started except for BPM.
- You can click on a step to activate/deactivate it.
- Switch between different tracks by using the 'current track' slider.
- Clicking the 'cycle' button will set the sequence to activate random steps every cycle.

This project is in very early development so there are some bugs and missing features!
