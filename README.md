<h1 align="center">SEQU</h1>
<h4 align="center">Current Version: <a href="https://ryan-pickert.github.io/sequ/">[0.1.0-pre-alpha]</a></h4>

SEQU is a modular synth designer and sequencing program built on <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a>.

**Undergoing heavy refactoring so the app is currently unavailiable.**

I am constantly working on SEQU in my spare time as a passion project.
This project is in very early development so there are a lot of bugs and missing features!
