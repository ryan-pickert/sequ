<h4 align="center">Current Version: <a href="https://ryan-pickert.github.io/sequ/">[0.4.1-pre-alpha]</a></h4>

SEQU is a multi-track step sequencer with a focus on randomization.
SEQU uses <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> as a clock source and <a href="https://github.com/djipco/webmidi">WebMidi.js</a> to send midi data.

**Features**
* Generate random squences using a set scale
* Generate a new sequence every cycle
* Activate/deactivate steps to your liking
* Up to four tracks playing simultaneously
* Send tracks to different devices or midi channels

**Quick Start Guide**

Connect your midi devices (if they aren't already) and restart the page.
The 'device' slider will default to the last midi device. 
>If the slider is on '1', then no devices were detected.
>Device '1' is usually the computer's thru port. All devices after '1' are your external devices.

To generate a sequence:
1. Set the parameters to your liking and hit the 'generate' button.
2. Choose the desired device and midi channel
3. Hit 'play' to start the sequence.

Notes:
- A sequence MUST be generated before starting it. Generating a new sequence while it is playing will have no effect until you restart it.
- All other parameters must also be set before the sequence is started except for the BPM.
- You can click on a step to activate/deactivate it.
- Switch between the tracks by using the current track slider.
- Toggling the cycle button will set the sequence to activate random steps when it ends.

This project is in very early development so there are some bugs and missing features!
