<h1 align="center">SEQU</h1>
<h4 align="center">Current Version: <a href="https://ryan-pickert.github.io/sequ/">[0.4.1-pre-alpha]</a></h4>

SEQU multi-track step sequencer with a focus on randomization.
SEQU uses <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> as a clock source and <a href="https://github.com/djipco/webmidi">WebMidi.js</a> to send midi data.

**Features**
* Generate random squences using a set scale
* Generate a new sequence every cycle
* Activate/deactivate steps to your liking
* Up to four tracks playing simultaniously
* Send tracks to different devices or midi channels

I am constantly working on SEQU in my spare time as a passion project.
This project is in very early development so there are some bugs and missing features!
